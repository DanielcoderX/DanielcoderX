# Hey, I'm DX 👋

I build things that make sense — clean, high-performance systems, tools, and ideas.  
I don’t chase trends or buzzwords. I focus on what works, what scales, and what lasts.  
Code, for me, isn’t a career path — it’s a language of thought. A way to express logic, precision, and creativity at the same time.

## 🧭 What Drives Me
I’m obsessed with **understanding how things actually work** — not just using frameworks, but tracing them down to the smallest detail.  
From low-level behavior to architecture design, I care about **clarity, simplicity, and raw performance**.  

I believe in:
- Writing code that’s minimal yet powerful.  
- Building systems that serve real purpose.  
- Thinking independently, questioning defaults, and avoiding noise.

I don’t romanticize coding — I respect it.  
It’s both a craft and a responsibility.

## ⚙️ What I Work With
Languages and tools are just means to an end, but these are what I usually reach for:
- **Go**, **Rust**, **Swift**, **Kotlin**, **C/C++**  
- System design, backend infrastructure, distributed logic  
- High-performance, cross-platform engineering  
- Experimenting with compilers, concurrency, and efficiency

## 🌌 Beyond Code
I read a lot about **physics**, **philosophy**, and **human behavior**.  
To me, software reflects its creator’s mindset — clean logic comes from clear thinking.  
Everything I build comes from that philosophy: understand first, create second.
